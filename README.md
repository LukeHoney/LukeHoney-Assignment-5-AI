# :world_map: MiniVill

The story places the user in MiniVill, a virtual world in which a few people live. The goal for the player is to have interactions with the locals and depending on the users’ actions different outcomes occur with a total of 4 end results. Speaking to the locals you will find out a bit about them but don’t be rude, gossip travels quickly. For example, if you are horrible to Adam, Sophie will know, and you might receive a couple of slaps. Don’t get to many slaps as this could send you to sleep. If you are nice to them, you might be rewarded to. Have fun exploring.

##  Features:
### :speaking_head: Dialogue

Your choices have consequences, not just good and bad. Pay attention to what the locals are telling you to have more positive interactions. If the user speaks to Sophie, she will tell the user that Adam is sad because it is his special day. This information informs the user what to say when talking to Adam, and if you get this wrong you will upset or even anger him but if you get it right, he will reward you. Another interaction the user can have been with the pub security. If you lie to him about having your ID, the entry fee to the pub gets doubled meaning you have less money to buy the better drink. Megan, who welcomes the user give a hit to where you can find your ID so one again you have to pay attention. All NPC’s that are involved in the story have at least one bit of audio dialogue and multiple animations.

### :couple: Crowd

The crowd is a combination of covid people and a knight. The covid people don’t like talking to you but they will get out of your way. The knight however will ask you to move out his way, if this happens on multiple occasions her will take your money as a fine and give to a slap of being in the way. The crowd will move in random directions with multiple targets and will switch between them at different rates.
